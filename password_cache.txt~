If you do not have the helper, you can download it with curl:

$git credential-osxkeychain
# Test for the cred helper

>>git: 'credential-osxkeychain' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.



$ curl -s -O http://github-media-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/osx/git-credential-osxkeychain
# Download the helper


$ chmod u+x git-credential-osxkeychain
# Fix the permissions on the file so it can be run


$ sudo mv git-credential-osxkeychain /usr/local/bin
# Move the file so git can access it

To tell git to use osxkeychain, simply set the global git config:

$ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
# Set git to use the osxkeychain credential helper

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires a password you will be 
prompted for your username and password, and to grant access to the OSX keychain.
After you've done this, the username and password are stored in your keychain and you
won't be required to type them in to git again.
